He discussed the projects he had worked on and also talked about his hobbies. He then summarized his insights regarding the world of Operations Research and Analytics. He classified OR/Analytics into four categories: descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics, predictive analytics, and prescriptive analytics and He explained the relationship between these topics and the EMU courses we are taking during our bachelor’s degree. After that, he began discussing analytical solutions used in the industry, such as the descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive methods, usage frequency, and delivery methods. Finally, he shared the lessons and experiences he gained from his professional life and answered students’ questions.\n\n\nOpen-ended question about the speaking\nQuestion: Give real-life examples illustrating the descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics methods.\nAnswer:\nDescriptive Analytics:\n\nFinancial reports, such as quarterly earnings.\nHealth statistics in a hospital, like the number of daily admissions.\n\nPredictive Analytics:\n\nWeather forecasting, using historical patterns to predict future conditions.\nCredit scoring for loan applications, assessing the likelihood of default.\n\nPrescriptive Analytics:\n\nFlight path optimization, where airlines select the most fuel-efficient and timely routes.\nPersonalized medicine, where treatment plans are suggested based on a patient’s genetic profile, lifestyle, and medical history.\n\n\n\nMultiple-choice question about the speaking\nQuestion: Which topic isn’t included in the descriptive analytics?\na-) Time-series analysis\nb-) Data visualization\nc-) Data mining\nd-) Optimization\nAnswer: The correct answer is option D. Descriptive analytics focuses on summarizing historical data to understand patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. Optimization is typically associated with prescriptive analytics, which aims to find the best course of action based on data.",

So instead of using for-loops I tried to use sapply function. I understood the structure of the sapply function from our lecture slide but for learing more about the sapply function I checked the w3schools.com and got help from chatGPT. For example I learned that for replacing NA factor values with my first name I should use the levels(x) because If I try to replace NA values in a factor column with a new value that isn't already defined as a level (e.g., x[is.na(x)] &lt;- \"Gokay\"), R won’t recognize this new value. The line levels(x) &lt;- c(levels(x), my_first_name) adds a new level to the existing levels of the factor. This allows you to safely assign the new value (\"Gokay\" in this case) when replacing NA values, as it is now recognized as a valid level.  \n\nmy_birth_year &lt;- 2000\nmy_first_name &lt;- \"Gokay\"\n\nreplaced_data &lt;- polls_us_election_2016\n\nreplaced_data[] &lt;- sapply(replaced_data, function(x) {\n  if (is.numeric(x)) {\n    # Replace NA in numeric columns with birth year\n    x[is.na(x)] &lt;- my_birth_year\n  } else if (is.factor(x)) {\n    # Add \"Gokay\" as a new factor level and replace NA\n    levels(x) &lt;- c(levels(x), my_first_name)\n    x[is.na(x)] &lt;- my_first_name\n  } else if (is.character(x)) {\n    # Replace NA in character columns with first name\n    x[is.na(x)] &lt;- my_first_name\n  }\n  return(x)\n}, simplify = FALSE)\n\n#Printing the first 10 rows of the new data frame and the total number of NAs\n#remaining in the new data frame.\n\nnew_first_ten_rows &lt;- head(replaced_data,10)\nprint(new_first_ten_rows)\n\n        state  startdate    enddate\n1        U.S. 2016-11-03 2016-11-06\n2        U.S. 2016-11-01 2016-11-07\n3        U.S. 2016-11-02 2016-11-06\n4        U.S. 2016-11-04 2016-11-07\n5        U.S. 2016-11-03 2016-11-06\n6        U.S. 2016-11-03 2016-11-06\n7        U.S. 2016-11-02 2016-11-06\n8        U.S. 2016-11-03 2016-11-05\n9  New Mexico 2016-11-06 2016-11-06\n10       U.S. 2016-11-04 2016-11-07\n                                                     pollster grade samplesize\n1                                    ABC News/Washington Post    A+       2220\n2                                     Google Consumer Surveys     B      26574\n3                                                       Ipsos    A-       2195\n4                                                      YouGov     B       3677\n5                                            Gravis Marketing    B-      16639\n6  Fox News/Anderson Robbins Research/Shaw & Company Research     A       1295\n7                                     CBS News/New York Times    A-       1426\n8                                NBC News/Wall Street Journal    A-       1282\n9                                                    Zia Poll Gokay       8439\n10                                                   IBD/TIPP    A-       1107\n   population rawpoll_clinton rawpoll_trump rawpoll_johnson rawpoll_mcmullin\n1          lv           47.00         43.00            4.00             2000\n2          lv           38.03         35.69            5.46             2000\n3          lv           42.00         39.00            6.00             2000\n4          lv           45.00         41.00            5.00             2000\n5          rv           47.00         43.00            3.00             2000\n6          lv           48.00         44.00            3.00             2000\n7          lv           45.00         41.00            5.00             2000\n8          lv           44.00         40.00            6.00             2000\n9          lv           46.00         44.00            6.00             2000\n10         lv           41.20         42.70            7.10             2000\n   adjpoll_clinton adjpoll_trump adjpoll_johnson adjpoll_mcmullin\n1         45.20163      41.72430        4.626221             2000\n2         43.34557      41.21439        5.175792             2000\n3         42.02638      38.81620        6.844734             2000\n4         45.65676      40.92004        6.069454             2000\n5         46.84089      42.33184        3.726098             2000\n6         49.02208      43.95631        3.057876             2000\n7         45.11649      40.92722        4.341786             2000\n8         43.58576      40.77325        5.365788             2000\n9         44.82594      41.59978        7.870127             2000\n10        42.92745      42.23545        6.316175             2000\n\nnew_num_of_NA &lt;- sum(is.na(replaced_data))\nprint(new_num_of_NA)\n\n[1] 0",
